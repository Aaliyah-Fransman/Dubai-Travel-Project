            <p>
              I’m an aspiring full stack developer, currently pursuing a degree
              in Information Technology. My journey into tech began in 2025
              through SheCodes, where I gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, React, Python, and responsive web design. I’m
              passionate about building end-to-end digital solutions from sleek,
              intuitive front end interfaces to robust back-end systems.
